# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** (It's pronounced Yen-CHEE SHU):wave:.<br>
I am a reporter at <a href="http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/" target="_blank"> NC Policy Watch </a> covering courts and law. Previously I was a data fellow at the Investigative Reporting Workshop in D.C. on the <a href="https://bit.ly/3saPgRB
" target="_blank">Public Accountability Project</a>. 
I have worn plenty of hats at different kinds of newsrooms, but I have always enjoyed learning about issues that touch people's lives and having conversations with people who I wouldn't have met but for my job. I truly believe in the power of storytelling that brings down barriers, resonates with people, and effects social changes. <br>
That has led me on the journey from a radio reporter to where I am at now. I hold an M.A. degree in Journalism from the University of Missouri, and majored in English with a concentration on International Journalism at the Communication University of China.<br>
I am from southern China. Coming a long way to see the world. When I am not writing or coding, you can probably find me enjoying music and films. Here's the a <a href="https://yanqi-xu.github.io/dc_concerts_map/" target="_blank">map </a> of all the concerts I went to in D.C. in 2019. Alas, pre-COVID times.<br>
Please <a href = '#contact'>get in touch!</a> I am always curious about what we can learn from each other.
