# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** (It's pronounced Yan-CHEE):wave:,<br>
I am a journalist, and I work a lot with data. To me, data journalism is like approaching storytelling with precision. I truly believe in the power of storytelling that brings down barriers, resonates with people, and effects social changes. I hold an M.A. degree in Journalism from the University of Missouri, and majored in English with a concentration on International Journalism at the Communication University of China.<br>
I am from southern China. Coming a long way to see the world. When I am not writing or coding, you can probably find me enjoying musics and films. Here's the a map of all the concerts I went to in D.C. in 2019. <br>
