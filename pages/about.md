# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** (It's pronounced Yan-CHEE):wave:.<br>
I am a journalist, and I work a lot with data. Currently I am a data fellow at the Investigative Reporting Workshop in D.C. on the Accountability Project. To me, data journalism is about approaching storytelling with precision, and about complicated socioeconomic variables made clear. I truly believe in the power of storytelling that brings down barriers, resonates with people, and effects social changes. <br>
That has led me on the journey from a radio reporter to where I am at now. I hold an M.A. degree in Journalism from the University of Missouri, and majored in English with a concentration on International Journalism at the Communication University of China.<br>
I am from southern China. Coming a long way to see the world. When I am not writing or coding, you can probably find me enjoying music and films. Here's the a <a href="https://yanqi-xu.github.io/dc_concerts_map/" target="_blank">map </a> of all the concerts I went to in D.C. in 2019. <br>
Please <a href = '#contact'>get in touch!</a> I am always curious about what we can learn from each other.
