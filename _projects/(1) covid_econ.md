description: COVID-19 caught the world off guard and caused the worst economic downtown since the Great Depression. How does it shape everyone's life? I explored the economic tolls of COVID-19 and the ensuing Great Lockdown by looking at mobility, flights, unemployment, trade, commodity prices, GDP and much more. I designed and developed this multimedia storytelling project, which was published by the Initium Media in June of 2020.
