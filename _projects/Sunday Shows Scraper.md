description: Sunday shows usually feature politicians and pundits making factual assertions. But have you ever wondered if their talking points are true? Enter the Sunday Shows Scraper that scrapes their statements, and submits to ClaimBuster, a natural-langugage-processing API that rates a statement's checkability. Used internally by fact-checkers to stay alert to potentially checkable claims.
