description: After I worked on the story about bus services in several college towns in the Midwest and used the Federal Transit database, I was curious about the served area and population statistics. To see if they are counting correctly, I decided to map every building's access to transit in Lawrence, KS, where the University of Kansas is situated.

# Network Analysis
Being in the Midwest, too many times you can find the closest bus stop seemingly close on a map, but going there is not as easy as it appears. Sometimes you can't go straight there becuase there's no roadway.

In order to determine walking access to bus stops, I used network analysis, which focuses on distance along the network (roads, etc.) instead of absolute distance.
