description: After I worked on the story about bus services in several college towns in the Midwest, I was curious about the served area and population statistics listed under the Federal Transit database profiles. To see how accurate the count was, I decided to map every building's access to transit in Lawrence, KS, where the University of Kansas is situated. This analysis shows that slightly less than half of buildings in Kansas have are within 400m/0.25 mile of walk along the raodway to the closest transit stop. It produces a much smaller number of served population. Lower-income neighborhoods also have a higher percentage of transit-accessible buildings.

# Network Analysis
Being in the Midwest, too many times you can find the closest bus stop seemingly close on a map, but going there is not as easy as it appears. Sometimes you can't go straight there becuase there's no roadway.

400 meters, or 0.25 mile, is commonly regarded as the maximum amount of distance accetpeople for most people to walk to a transit stop.

In order to determine walking access to bus stops, I used network analysis, which focuses on distance along the network (roads, etc.) instead of absolute distance.
