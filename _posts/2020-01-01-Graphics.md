### Maps
{% include elements/figure.html image="../assets/img/RUNOFF.gif" id = "water_runoff"%}
I obtained a list of names of water bodies considered polluted under the Missouri regulations versus the EPA standards. To visualize the stark difference in numbers, I then {% include elements/highlight.html text="geocoded" %} the names of the rivers and plotted them on the map using {% include elements/highlight.html text="QGIS" %}. Two maps were generated and overlaid in {% include elements/highlight.html text="PhotoShop" %}. 

{% include elements/figure.html image="../assets/img/indiatoilet_annotated.png" caption="This “Clean India” campaign has built more than 90 million new latrines and toilets in four years" %}
I used Excel to {% include elements/highlight.html text="scrape" %} the data from the India Mnistry of Drinking Water and Sanitaion, and generated the map with {% include elements/highlight.html text="ArcMap" %}.

### Infographics

{% include elements/figure.html image="../assets/img/UBERingraphics.png"%}
I requested the taxi registration data from the Office of Business License in Columbia. After crunching the numbers in {% include elements/highlight.html text="R" %}, I also wrote a {% include elements/highlight.html text="pictogram function" %} to arrange the taxi icons, so that they were spaced and aligned consistently. Then I exported the SVG, designed and rendered the graphic in {% include elements/highlight.html text="Photoshop" %}.

I synthesized interviews and public records, and designed this graphic in {% include elements/highlight.html text="Canva" %}.
