### Infographics

#### COVID-19 Cases

I made the following infographics for the Initium Media, a Hong Kong-based online news publication. These graphics were originally published in Chinese language on April 12, 2020.

Then I exported the SVG, designed and rendered the graphic in {% include elements/highlight.html text="Photoshop" %}.

I obtained a list of names of water bodies considered polluted under the Missouri regulations versus the EPA standards. To visualize the stark difference in numbers, I then worked with the team to geocode the address and plotted them on the map. Two maps were generated and overlaid in PhotoShop. 

{% include elements/figure.html image="../assets/img/indiatoilet_annotated.png" caption="This “Clean India” campaign has built more than 90 million new latrines and toilets in four years" %}
I used Excel to {% include elements/highlight.html text="scrape" %} the data from the India Mnistry of Drinking Water and Sanitaion,
