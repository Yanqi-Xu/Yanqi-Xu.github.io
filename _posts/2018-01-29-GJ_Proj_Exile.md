description: I did an interview with an exiled journalist  who was forced out of his motherland Sri Lanka, after he wrote an editorial blaming the former president Mahinda Rajapaksaâ€™s administration for the killing of Lasantha Wickrematunge, and refused to run a story pitched by the army that couldn't be verified.
