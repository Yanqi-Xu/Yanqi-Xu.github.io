## What I do
I hear and help polish their pitches, which were presented to the newsroom and voted on. Then I give assitant producers instructions on the types of guests we would want to include on our panel, and help them reach out to the potential guests. 

## The day of
Assistant producers come in the studio to cue the visuals, and live tweets for social promotion. I operate the Skype backend to make sure that everyone is on time and their camera and mic were set up properly.


## What I enjoy the most
Most of the producers came in and had no experience producing a whole 30-minute show. I help them make an idea come together.
I also used my GIS knowledge to make this graphic for my last show at Global Journalist, presenting the significant growth of India's toilet-equipped households.
